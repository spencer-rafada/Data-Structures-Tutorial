# README!

This repository is a requirement project for my Programming with Data Structures class for Fall 2021. 

It is a beginner-friendly Python tutorial about Data Structures. It talks about [queues](1-queue.md), [linked lists](2-linkedlist.md), and [trees](tree.md). It briefly talks about the [Big-O notation](0.5-performance.md).

# Queue

Have you finished the takeaway tasks from the introduction yet? Well, if you didn't, you should have at least tried to because that is how these modules are designed for understanding. **Prepare** to class by reading, **attend** classroom discussions, and **do** takeaway tasks.

If you did do the task, what is the process of doing it? Is the **order** of arranging the parts important or not? Yes, **the order is important** for that specific task.

Today, we will talk about a data structure wherein the order the data is enterred is important too! This Data Structure is known as a **Queue**.

**What are Queues?**
-
**Queues** is characterized as *"First In, First Out"* system and can be implemented using a Python lists.

In the example from the [introduction](0-introduction.md), we will assume that the tower of tires is a list.

In Python code, the code would look like this...
```python
tires = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# The #1 tire is the bottom one since it is the first one that is put.
```

In Task 1, we used **Stacks** to solve the problem. It is a lot faster to take the tire from the top of the tower than taking the most bottom one. Meanwhile, for task 2, we used **Queues** to solve the problem. However, for this specific problem it is not safe to use tires that has been sitting in the garage for too long because it may develop *tire bubbles*.

>Remember: That is the tradeoff when deciding what Data Structure to implement in our solution to the problem. There is no "best data structures" in general, but there is a "best data structures for a specific task."

By the way, Stacks are *"First in, First Out"* system that can also be implemented using Python lists. However, we will not focus on Stacks, but here is a link if you want to learn more about [Stacks](https://byui-cse.github.io/cse212-course/lesson03/03-prepare.html).
